This repo contains homework from the SQL lecture series from The Columbia Engineering Data Analytics Boot Camp.


In this assignment, I have designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, this project includes:
* Data Modeling
* Data Engineering
* Data Analysis


**Data Modeling**

An ERD based on the data in the CSV files.

**Data Engineering**
* Use the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

**Data Analysis**

And the analysis includes the following:
* List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
* List employees who were hired in 1986.
* List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
* List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
* List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.


##### Bonus (Optional)
1. Imported the SQL database into Pandas. 
2. Created a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.
3. Created a bar chart of average salary by title.
